#Minesweeper


I have created 9*9 grid which makes a total of 81 boxes.
Out of these 81 boxes, 10 boxes contain bombs and other boxes are safe.
If a safe box is clicked, the user is awarded a point
If a user clicks on a box containing a bomb, the game gets over and you need to give an option to the user to start a fresh game.

Create an array of random numbers having 10 numbers where each number lies between 1 to 81.
Every number in the array should be unique.
The numbers in the array are nothing but indices where the bomb is planted.
If a bomb is clicked you need to highlight all the boxes that contained the bomb with red color.
You may color clicked boxes with green color and boxes which have not been clicked should remain white.
As soon as a box containing a bomb is clicked you need to color that box red.
